This exclusion does not apply to temporary foreign workers, most international students, Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate and extended families provided they remain in Canada for 15 days or more. Land borders are operating at reduced capacity and with limited hours. Anyone arriving in Canada must self-quarantine for 14 days, and have a credible self-isolation plan. Immediate and extended family members planning to stay for less than 15 days must be travelling for an essential purpose. Further details are available on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-special-measures.html\">website</a> or call the Canada Border Service Agency helpline: 1 800 461 9999. \nAt point of departure, air operators must complete a basic health assessment of every passenger. No passengers (regardless of citizenship) who are showing symptoms of coronavirus will be allowed to board. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. Further information is available on Transport Canada’s <a href=\"https://tc.canada.ca/en/initiatives/covid-19-measures-updates-guidance-issued-transport-canada/covid-19-information-travellers\">website</a>.  \n Only Toronto Pearson (YYZ), Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau (YUL), Calgary International Airport (YYC) and Vancouver International Airport (YVR) are operating international flights. Domestic flights, as well as flights from the United States, some destinations such as Mexico and the Caribbean, and from St. Pierre-et-Miquelon, are currently not affected by this measure. You should check with your airline before you travel for the most up to date information. \nCruise ships with overnight accommodation allowed to carry more than 100 passengers are prohibited from operating in Canadian waters until 31 October 2020. Further information on COVID-19 measures for cruise ships and other passenger vessels is available on Transport Canada’s website <a href=\"https://www.tc.gc.ca/en/initiatives/covid-19-measures-updates-guidance-tc/backgrounder-updated-covid-19-measures-cruise-ships-other-passenger-vessels.html\">here</a> . \nCanadian authorities require passengers to wear a face covering on flights to and from Canada, and within airport terminals in Canada.\nThe Canadian authorities require visitors transiting through Canada to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) unless you are otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). \nPeople displaying symptoms of coronavirus when they arrive in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.\nYou should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. \n Everyone arriving in Canada is legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Heavy penalties apply if you fail to comply. From 15 April, you must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly family members or failing to have a set destination. Travellers who are unable to produce a credible plan will be placed in a quarantine location, such as a hotel, for a 2-week period.\n <br>\n <br> \n Internal Restrictions:\n To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include: a ban on large social gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible; closure of schools, colleges and many public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres; closure of bars and restaurants in many cities and regions; some public transport offering only a limited service,\n Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate.\n The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. \nFederal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus.

    "info": "Latest News: New changes in COVID-19 quarantine measures from 5 November (02.11.2020). Santiago area gradually emerges from COVID-19 lockdown.Currently, 15 boroughs in the metropolitan area are still under lockdown. (Xinhua, 08.09.2020). \n <br>\n <br> \n International Restrictions:\n*Entry to Chile:  On 18 March 2020 the Chilean Government introduced a prohibition on entry into the country, except for Chilean nationals and foreign nationals with valid residency visas for Chile. However, if you can prove family connections with Chileans or foreigners resident in Chile, you can contact the nearest Chilean Consulate to request a ‘special permit to entry’ (Salvoconducto) prior to your travel. It is possible to transit through Chile, as long as you remain airside throughout your journey. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Chile has a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. If you are travelling by air, you will be handed a health form to fill in during the flight, to hand to authorities on arrival. At the airport, you will have your temperature checked. You will also need to confirm to authorities where you will be staying during quarantine and provide details of how you will be travelling to that location (including the name of the taxi company that you are using, if relevant). Since 19 October, Chilean nationals, foreign nationals with Chilean residency and non-residents carrying a special permit of entry (salvoconducto) issued by a Chilean Consulate overseas, can request a quarantine exemption on arrival if they can show a negative PCR-test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Chile. This test should be completed by a recognised laboratory licensed to do such tests. If travellers do not have a negative PCR-test on arrival, the 14-day quarantine restriction from arrival date is mandatory. Travellers with quarantine restrictions also have the option to take a PCR-test in Chile. This could reduce the time spent in quarantine. This request must be arranged by the traveller on arrival. The local health authorities will need to confirm the negative PCR-test result. You should be aware that health authorities are prioritising requests based on compassionate reasons. For more details please contact the Chilean COVID Health-line 6003607777 option 0. The Chilean authorities have closed all ports to cruise liners.\n <br>\n <br> \nInternal Restrictions:\n*Travel in Chile: If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces/public transport, including the airport.\nQuarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. A nationwide curfew (now running between 11pm to 5am) has been in place since 22 March.\nBe aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards. On 28 July, as part of the Chilean government’s step-by-step, five stage plan for the parts of Chile under quarantine orders to emerge in a phased manner from lockdown, comunas across Chile began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into later stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; prohibition of movement to secondary home. This remains the status for much of the country. Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 10 people allowed; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there will be no more mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 50 people; curfew, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to a secondary home. Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 50 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Curfew and cordon sanitaire dependent on local authority decision; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Re-opening of borders.\nStage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. The Government’s <a href=\"https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/coronavirus/cuarentena \">“Chile Atiende” website</a>  outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is in under the first heading (“En qué lugares de Chile hay cuarantena?”). In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the <a href=\"https://comisariavirtual.cl/\">Comisaria Virtual</a>. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a <a href=\"https://comisariavirtual.cl/\">“Salvoconducto” permit </a>  and a<a href=\"https://www.c19.cl/formularios.html\">“Health Passport”</a>   (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.\nInformation on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s <a href=\"https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/coronavirus/cuarentena\">“Chile Atiende” website</a> under the seventh heading (“Dónde hay aduanas sanitarias y cordones sanitarios?”).\nCheckpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a <a href=\"https://www.c19.cl/\">“Health Passport”</a>  prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br>\n*Public places and services:  Chilean authorities require the use of masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.",

    "info": "Latest News: Chinese government suspends entry for residents of Britain because of increase in COVID-19 infections in U.K. (AP, 05.11.2020). 70 percent of flights in, out of Kashi, Xinjiang canceled as four high-risk counties reportedly in lockdown (Global Times China, 26.10.2020) Domestic travelers to, from Shanghai face mandatory 14-day quarantine amid COVID-19 concerns (Shine, 12.10.2020)\n <br>\n <br> \nInternational Restrictions: \nCommercial flights are operating to and from China. International airlines may only maintain one route to China, operating one flight per week. \n*Entry and transit:  You will need a valid visa to enter China. Chinese Visa Application Centres have re-opened. More information on the categories of visas and requirements are available at Chinese Embassies and <a href=\"http://cs.mfa.gov.cn/wgrlh/lhqz/lhqzjjs/t1095035.shtml\">MFA website</a>r.\nFrom 28 September 2020, holders of valid residence permits attached to work, personal matters and reunion can re-enter China. Holders of expired residence permits can apply for a new one. You should check the eligibility of your visa with a Chinese Embassy or Consulate before booking travel.\nFrom 21 August, you will also need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel. The Chinese Embassy/Consulate will certify your form and return it to you via email. More details on these requirements, including the process for submitting your form, can be found from your local Chinese Embassy. From 7 September, alongside the form, you must provide evidence of a negative test for COVID-19 taken no more than 3 days before you travel. This has changed from 5 days. The Chinese authorities have specified a ‘nucleic acid’ test which they have explained is the standard test for COVID-19. A limited number of international flights are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>\n*Health checks on arrival:  All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment.\nHealth regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Non-residents may be charged for their care. Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralized government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will be required to go into a government quarantine hospital. For all quarantine arrangements in China: •        Unless directed by the authorities you are not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you are also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine\n•        Depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi. •        During your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room. •        If meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside. •        Larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. •        If you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication.\nFailure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.\n <br>\n <br> \n Internal Restrictions: \n*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly requiring use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces require travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.",

Aviation authority extends restrictions for international flights until 1 October (Georgia Today, 17.08.2020) \n <br>\n <br>\n International Restrictions:\n*Entry to Georgia: \nForeign citizens are not currently allowed to enter Georgia, apart from citizens or permanent residents of five EU Member States (France, Germany, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) who arrive by direct flight. The ban also applies to foreigners with Georgian residence permits. \nThere are two work-related schemes for foreign citizens from other countries to enter Georgia:\nBusiness trips by citizens of any country will be allowed if a permit is obtained. If applicable, you should <a href=\"https://stopcov.ge/\">fill in the relevant form</a>  to apply for entry.\n“Work from Georgia” scheme is available to citizens from 95 countries, including the UK, who want to work from Georgia remotely. If applicable, you should complete the relevant application <a href=\"https://stopcov.ge/\">form</a>. Conditions apply, including a minimum salary level of $2,000 a month, the ability to pay Georgian taxes, and health insurance.

Those on an approved business permit have the option to take a PCR test every 72 hours instead of quarantine. Tests and quarantine will be at your own expense. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.\nFor those with access to their own accommodation in Georgia it may be possible to self-isolate at home, rather than enter a quarantine hotel designated by the health authorities.

Taxis can hold no more than three people in a single vehicle, including the driver, with passengers sitting in the rear. If travelling from or to Tbilisi airport by taxi this social distancing rule must still be observed. Face masks must be worn in all public transport and taxis, as well as on the streets.\n\n\nAccommodation - Some hotels and other rental accommodation have re-opened but many remain closed. Face masks must be worn when entering public spaces inside hotels and rental accommodation. \nPublic spaces and services - Enforcement of regulations on social distancing and masks is being tightened as coronavirus cases have risen following the summer holidays. No more than 10 people can participate in social gatherings such as weddings and funerals, indoor or out. There is no limit on gatherings for political or election-related activities. Most shops, and some restaurants and hotels are open. \nRestaurants, cafes and bars must close by 10pm nationwide. Working from home is recommended where possible. Schools have restarted but teaching is on-line in Tbilisi and several other larger towns. Kindergartens will close in Tbilisi from 5 November. Universities have reopened but most teaching is on-line. \nIt is mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces such as shops, when entering hotels and restaurants, and on public transport as well as outdoors. Failing to do so can result in a 20 Lari fine for an individual or 500 Lari for a legal entity.

Travellers entering Germany from a designated risk area must enter quarantine for 14 days and take a COVID-19 test. They are also required to notify the local German health authority in their place of residence/accommodation. Northern Ireland, Scotland, North East England, North West England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and Wales have been designated as high risk areas. If you have been in the designated high risk areas in the two weeks prior to their arrival in Germany, you are required to proceed directly to your accommodation and quarantine for 14 days or until you can show evidence of a negative test result. Those who can provide evidence of a negative test taken in a European Union member state or a state with comparable quality standards less than 48 hours prior to arrival may be exempted from the requirement to quarantine. Individual federal states are responsible for the implementation of quarantine regulations and local rules may vary. \nEntry into Germany from third countries (outside the EU/EEA and the UK): The rules for entering Germany from third countries concern travellers’ place of immediate prior stay, not their nationality. Entry from any third country is possible for travellers who can demonstrate an important reason for their travel. The list of important reasons covers German and EU citizens and any third-country nationals with a right of residency in Germany. It also includes healthcare and social care personnel and health researchers, skilled workers whose economic activity is necessary and cannot be postponed or performed from abroad, freight and transport staff, seasonal workers, students who cannot continue their studies from abroad, travellers making visits for urgent family reasons, diplomats and staff at international organisations, and persons transiting Germany.\n <br>  \n*From within the EU: Entry restrictions- Entry from EU Member States + Schengen Associated countries is allowed without restrictions, unless a country or region is defined as high risk area. The Robert Koch Institute provides a <a href=\"https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Risikogebiete_neu.html\">list of international risk areas</a>, which is updated regularly. A country or an area is defined as \"high-risk\" when there are more than 50 new infections per 100,000 people over the last seven days. Travellers entering the Federal Republic of Germany, who have been in a risk area at any time within the last 14 days before entry, are obliged to self-isolate in accordance with the testing and quarantine regulations obligations of the competent Federal State. The entry rule is based on the country from which the traveller is coming from, and not on nationality. Specific rules for <a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/EN/2020/08/einreise-unverheirateter-paare-en.html\">Unmarried partners from third countries</a> are available.

The third-country national must provide evidence that the conditions listed above have been met. Airline or other travel tickets, etc. may be presented to meet conditions (1) and (2). To meet condition (3), the traveller may present a document issued by the responsible authorities of the country of destination (or another transit country) certifying that entry restrictions have been waived or that approval of entry has been granted. Such a document is necessary in particular if the third-country national does not meet the requirements for entering Germany but does meet the entry requirements of the country of destination (or, if applicable, of another transit country). Germany's border control officials only check for compliance with the requirements for entering Germany. The obligation to self-isolate at home does not apply in the case of transit through Germany. In this case, however, you are obliged to leave Germany immediately. \nMore information is available at <a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268\">Coronavirus and entry restrictions.</a> And <a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/covid-19/2296762\">Latest information in German</a>.\n<br>\n*From Third Countries: Germany lifted the restrictions on travel for residents of the following third countries: Australia, Canada, Georgia, New Zealand, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay. This list will include Japan, South Korea, and China as soon as the possibility of mutual entry is confirmed. For all persons residing in a third country that is not included in the above list, the current restrictions on travel continue to apply. These persons may enter Germany only if there is an urgent need for their travel. Please see more information on <a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/travel-restrictions-border-control/travel-restriction-border-control-list.html#f13919566\">what constitutes an urgent need for entry</a>. The restrictions do not apply to German citizens. Also, citizens and family members (spouse, unmarried minor children, parents of minors) of EU Member States + Schengen Associated countries are exempted from the travel restrictions. The same applies to third-country nationals who already have a longer-term right of residence in an EU member state or a Schengen country or the United Kingdom (residence permit or long-term visa) and the members of their family. Unmarried partners may enter Germany from third countries that are not included in the above list, for short-term visits to the partner living in Germany when the general entry requirements (passport and visa, if applicable) are met, under the condition that the couple is in a long-term relationship/partnership and both partners have met in person in Germany at least once, or the couple had a previous shared residence in another country until recently. See <a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/EN/news/declaration-existence-relationship.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5\">declaration of the existence of the relationship</a>. Provided that the general entry requirements are met, unmarried couples travelling together may enter Germany for short-term visits for urgent reasons from third countries that are not included in the above list: their relationship is a long-term relationship between a third-country national and a German, or EU+ citizen or national and the couple has a shared residence abroad and there is an important reason for both partners to enter Germany. This is generally the case for births, weddings, bereavements/funerals or other exceptional cases in which there is an urgent family reason (e.g. serious illness of a first- or second-degree relative who therefore urgently needs help). The urgent reason for the joint entry of both partners is to be submitted in writing on entering Germany, together with a <a href=\"https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/EN/news/declaration-existence-relationship-urgent-reason-entry-en.html;jsessionid=7BF52F7715CA6AAD3DF26323B91843AF.2_cid373\">declaration</a> of the existence of the relationship. Additional documentation such as photos, social media posts, postal/email correspondence may also be provided. The decision whether to allow entry at the border is at the discretion of the border officials. All travellers must additionally follow the quarantine rules of the relevant federal state of Germany.\n <br>\n <br>\nInternal Restrictions: \nPublic spaces and services\nFrom 2 November, there will be a range of restrictions on social contact in Germany, aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19:\n•        Individuals will only be able to gather with members of their own and one additional household up to 10 people.\n•        Beauty salons, tattoo salons, massage parlours are closed.

Its use is voluntary, but the Government has underlined that its effectiveness will depend on how many download and use it. The App is built on the framework developed by Apple and Google. It uses Bluetooth technology to create a record of codes sent on a continuous basis by devices using the App. When two users enter in close contact with each other, their devices exchange their random codes, recording the contact in the device memory. The random codes are transferred to a server located in Italy and managed by the Ministry of Health. If one user tests positive for Covid-19, this information is voluntarily sent to the server and from there downloaded on all the devices where the App is installed.

On the national level, it is mandatory to have a mask on one's person anytime you leave your residence (to be worn in enclosed areas and whenever crowding occurs outdoors), though regions may apply stricter requirements. Please be aware that the use of masks in public at all times continues to be mandatory in Lazio (including Rome). Violations are subject to fines starting at 400 EUR. Exceptions to this requirement apply for children under the age of 6 and for persons with medical conditions incompatible with the use of a mask. Masks also do not need to be worn when engaging in physical activity or at restaurants and bars only when consuming food or beverages. <br> <br> *Travel in Italy: All travellers entering Italy must comply with the regulations of the region they are visiting. Public transport links may be less frequent and seating limited to comply with social distancing measures. Masks must be worn on board public services. Taxi and car hire options are widely available. Rail services are returning to their usual timetables, but there are still some reduced domestic services and international travel is limited. Some cross-border bus companies have cancelled their services. From 15 August, Italian flagged cruise ships can recommence sailings, available to residents of Schengen countries. Passenger ferry schedules remain subject to change and cancellations. Speak to your tour operator or transport provider for the latest information. More information on all these requirements is available from the <a href=\"http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=5412&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> or the European Union’s <a href=\"https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/ITA/2002\">Re-Open EU page</a>. <br>\n *Public spaces and services: Italian society has broadly reopened following the initial Coronavirus lockdown, however the following measures are in place: • Social distancing of one metre must be observed.• The use of masks is mandatory in all public spaces, whether outdoors or indoors. You should pay close attention to signage when travelling and carry a mask with you at all times.• Only six people can sit together at a restaurant, bar or café. These venues must close by midnight and from 6pm can only serve customers who are seated at a table.• Some regions have introduced nightly curfews or restrictions on movement; you should check regional websites to see if these will apply to you.• Seating will be preassigned within theatres, cinemas and concert venues and has been limited to permit social distancing.• Dance activity in nightclubs and open air venues has been suspended and parties are not permitted.• Museums and archaeological sites are open but entry must be pre-booked.• Parks are open and outdoor exercise is permitted, subject to social distancing.• Funerals are permitted to take place with limited attendance. Churches can celebrate mass, weddings and baptisms. Receptions following civil and religious ceremonies are limited to 30 people. Regional authorities in Italy are empowered to adjust these measures in keeping with local requirements; regional differences may therefore apply in addition to the restrictions listed above. Measures may also vary between towns; local mayors were recently given powers to close some public spaces from 9pm if they choose. Note that many restaurants and venues are asking patrons to provide their name and contact details before using their services.

Non-Japanese nationals wishing to visit for short-term business purposes are also permitted to enter, provided that they have a visa. However, the number of people permitted to enter Japan under these rules will be restricted, with priority given to those moving to Japan. Non-Japanese nationals arriving will need to provide written evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result conducted within 72 hours of their flight departure time if they have visited <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html\">this list of countries</a> in the last 14 days.  You will also need to provide written assurance from your company or sponsor that quarantine measures will be followed upon arrival (see below). Further details are available on the <a href=\"https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page22e_000921.html\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>, Japanese Embassy for more information.

There is currently no indication of when this might change. You may wish to confirm possible eligibility with your nearest Japanese Embassy for any other exceptions to enter Japan, including for humanitarian reasons. <br>\n*Re-entry to Japan:  British nationals with Status of Residence in Japan and who leave or have left Japan with a valid re-entry permit are allowed to re-enter Japan.

This includes short-term tourist visas, subject to proof that you were not able to easily leave Japan for COVID-19 related reasons. The three-month period starts from the date the visa expires – you must visit an immigration centre to renew your visa during this time. You will need to present a valid visa when leaving Japan. Visas expiring after 1 August must be renewed using the normal process – you should contact the Immigration Services Agency. <br>\n*Transiting Japan:  These measures do not apply to passengers who are transiting through the same airport and do not go through immigration. If you are transiting using different airports you will need a transit permit on arrival. To get one you will be required to demonstrate that you have not come from a country on the banned list, that you have timely onward travel plans and show that you will not use public transport to move between airports; this includes taxis. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.

You will be asked to wait for the test results at the airport before moving to your accommodation. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Foreign nationals with Status of Residence in Japan who leave Japan for short-term business travel only will be exempted from self-isolation requirements on return, provided they meet certain conditions.

All other passengers arriving in Japan are required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival at a designated location (such as a hotel or your own home) and to avoid using public transport, including on leaving the airport. These measures will remain in place for the foreseeable future. \n<br>\n<br>\nInternal Restrictions: \n The majority of businesses are now open, with some restrictions on mass gatherings over 5000 people. Measures encouraging social distancing, wearing masks in public, avoiding closed spaces, and exercising other <a href=\"https://corona.go.jp/prevention/pdf/en.newlifestyle.pdf\">basic precautions</a> remain in place. Controls may also be strengthened in the event of renewed outbreaks.

Movement is now prohibited between 9pm and 5am. Public and private gatherings such as weddings and funerals have been banned throughout the country until further notice - you should check with organisers before attending any function. The airport is operational and all passengers are required to have their tickets with them when transferring to and from the airport. Some exemptions to COVID-19 restrictions are applied to aid workers. For further clarification, aid workers should contact the United Nations for advice. Fabric masks covering the mouth and nose must be worn when outside the home and in vehicles (unless travelling alone or exercising).

Brussels Airlines is operating a reduced flight schedule. \nOther airlines have not confirmed planned flights. If you wish to travel, you should contact your airline or travel agent for confirmation of flight schedules. \nCurrently all land borders (with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire) are closed to travellers. Ports remain open. \nAll travellers arriving in Liberia will be screened for the coronavirus. On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a quarantine facility. In Roberts International Airport, you must stand in marked spaces within the terminal to allow for social distancing. \nPassengers entering Liberia have two options for COVID-19 testing. Government of Liberia strongly encourages travellers to be tested before arrival in Liberia. You can have a COVID-19 PCR test at your point of departure within 72 hours before your arrival in Liberia. If you present a negative PCR test result on arrival in Liberia, you will be allowed entry with symptom monitoring via USSD or mobile app. \nIf you do not do a pre-departure PCR test before your arrival in Liberia, you will be tested on arrival. You will have to do a Rapid Test, and a swab will be collected for PCR test processing. If your Rapid Test result is negative, you will be allowed entry with symptom monitoring via USSD or mobile app. \nIf your Rapid Test result is positive, you will be taken to a government quarantine facility pending your PCR test result. Sample processing could take several days. If your subsequent PCR result is positive you must remain in government quarantine. It is likely you will have to remain in quarantine until you have two consecutive negative PCR results.Quarantine may last 14 days or longer. \nYou should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and precautionary observation requirements with no advance notice.\nYou are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Liberia, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.\nAll foreign citizens in quarantine or self-isolation will have their passports removed and held by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) for 14 days. You will be given a copy of your passport to retain whilst in quarantine. If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in 14 days of quarantine. <br>\nLeaving Liberia: before departure from Liberia, you’ll need a negative COVID-19 test result, and a travel certificate issued by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/national-public-health-institute-of-liberia-nphil/travel-application-procedures/3691547654208248/\">(NPHIL)</a> (charge of US$75 ). You must go to an NPHIL COVID-19 sample collection site at least 72 hours before your travel date, to give a sample for PCR testing. Call the COVID-19 Hotline on 4455 for collection site details. Testing is available at the Union Testing Center located in Sophia, Congo Town, Monrovia from 9 am –4 pm, 7 days per week.  You must also apply for a travel certificate at least 72 hours before your travel date.

It will then review the situation. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. \nThese arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br>\n*Testing/Screening on arrival: There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. \nTesting requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The standard quarantine period for new arrivals is 28 days (21 days in a government-arranged facility, followed by 7 days of home quarantine). However, foreign nationals can, through contacting their nearest Myanmar Embassy, request permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. In this case, the quarantine requirements are as follows:\n•        Complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test. \n•        Provide evidence of a negative COVID test result. \n•        Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival).\n•        Undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will be required to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior. \nThe government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight tests positive for COVID-19. If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.\nThese arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from a Myanmar Embassy well in advance of your departure. <br>\n*Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.\n <br>\n <br>\n Internal Restrictions: \nAll airlines in Myanmar have suspended their domestic flights until 15 November. You should contact individual airlines for details. \nIn some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country to quarantine or self-isolate for up to at least 28 days on arrival. Further local preventative measures may also be in effect in regions, townships, wards, and village tracks across Myanmar, including in Yangon. Additional movement restrictions may be imposed in specific townships if COVID-19 cases are found. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures.\nAll townships in Yangon, except for the Coco Island Region, are currently under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. The rules state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the Government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 11pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon. \nOther parts of Myanmar are also under ’Stay at Home’ orders. You should confirm with the local ward administrator if you are unsure whether an area is subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Anyone wishing to travel to or from an area subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order should contact the relevant local authorities to confirm the requirements for travel. \nMyanmar will hold national elections on 8 November. Although people living in areas under stay at home orders will be allowed to leave their homes and gather in groups of up to 30 for voting, Myanmar’s COVID-19 measures remain in place for all other reasons. \nThis guidance from the government of Myanmar is subject to change, and you should check the information issued by the <a href=\"https://www.mofa.gov.mm/\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> on their website and on their  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mofamyanmar/\">Facebook Page</a> before you travel inside Myanmar. Further information is also available on the Facebook page for the Ministry of Health and Sports. If you are outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy.\nSince 13 May it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders.\nIt is recommended that foreigners carry:\n•        passport\n•        Form C (immigration document)\n•        Foreigner’s Registration Certificate\n•        Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car)\n•        a copy of your passport information page\n•        a copy of your Myanmar visa\n•        a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar.\n<br>\n*Accommodation: \nThere have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign tourists are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. If you are on a tourist visa and are not currently staying in a registered hotel or guest house, you should move into one now. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa.\nSome hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed. <br>\n*Public places and services:\nSome restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may require customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in public places.\nThe government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced.",

During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test.\n•        Provide evidence of a negative COVID test result.\n•        Complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival).\n•        Undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will be required to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.\nThe government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight tests positive for COVID-19. If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to purchase food or make phone calls.\nThese arrangements are subject to change and at short notice.",

New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption. There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand. The following people should seek approval from Immigration New Zealand (INZ) using the limited exceptions process: partners, dependent children (aged 24 years and under) and legal guardians of New Zealand citizens and residents; Australian citizens and permanent residents who normally live in New Zealand; essential health workers; other essential workers who are specifically agreed to by the New Zealand Government; Samoan and Tongan citizens making essential travel; New Zealand-based partners and dependent children (aged 19 years and under) of a work or student visa holder who is in New Zealand; critical humanitarian travel; maritime crew.  On 12 June, the Government introduced short term and long-term criteria for “Other Essential Workers” requests.

A request for approval to travel to New Zealand can take up to two days to process. <br>. \n*Quarantine requirements: Anyone entering New Zealand is required to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community.\nFrom 5 October, travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation.

Symptomatic individuals will be subject to a COVID-19 test and hospitalisation if found positive. Passengers who do not show symptoms and/or test negative may continue their journey. Transit passengers at Seoul Incheon Airport require a ticket/boarding pass for their onward flight to their final destination. They should confirm with the airline(s) before departure that their bags have been checked through to their final destination (as transit passengers are not able to collect and re-check in baggage on arrival in Incheon Airport). Transit hotels are available in both Terminals 1 and 2 at Incheon Airport. <br>\n*Testing / screening on arrival:  All arrivals – regardless of nationality and length of stay – are required to be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) and to undergo quarantine for 14 days. All individuals regardless of nationality who show coronavirus symptoms on arrival will be tested. Those who test positive will be isolated and treated at a hospital or community treatment centre. For those not showing symptoms on arrival, Korean nationals, and long term foreign visitors with an Alien Registration Card and Korean residence, may self-quarantine at home. Arrivals from the USA and Europe must receive a test within three days; arrivals from elsewhere must receive a test within 14 days. All other foreign short-term travellers must quarantine at a government-designated facility for 14 days on arrival. Arrivals from the USA and Europe will be tested on entry before transferring to the quarantine facility; arrivals from elsewhere will move to the quarantine facility and be tested within 14 days. Individuals are required to pay a daily charge of around 100,000KRW while in government quarantine facilities. There is currently no charge for hospital/community centre treatment for those testing positive. It is worth noting that individuals testing positive on arrival may spend over a month in hospital/community treatment centres before successfully testing negative and being discharged. If you display symptoms or return a positive test result for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

You must receive approval before you travel from the Embassy of the Republic of Korea where you are. Those with an exemption will still be tested for COVID-19 on arrival, and will need to participate with an active monitoring system via regular calls with a health expert and a specialised mobile App. Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities daily on your state of health. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. Immigration authorities will undertake a test call before travellers leave the airport, and any individual unable to verify their contact details may be denied entry to South Korea.\n <br>\n <br>\n Internal Restrictions:\n*Public spaces and services: Facemasks are compulsory in public places and on public transport.

Russia has restored air travel with Britain, South Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Tanzania and Central Asian neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. From 1 November, airports in Moscow will be able to operate two flights per week to Tokyo, Belgrade and the Cuban islands of Cayo Coco and Cayo Santa Maria. One weekly flight will operate from Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok to Tokyo. \n On 18 March 2020 the Russian government introduced restrictions on entry into the whole country for almost all foreign citizens. On 30 March, temporary restrictions on entry and exit via Russia’s land borders were enforced. The duration of these remains unspecified. The restrictions do not apply to certain groups, including members of diplomatic missions and highly qualified specialists. \n Foreigners arriving in Russia must provide a medical certificate (in Russian or English) with the test result for a COVID-19 PCR test conducted not more than three days prior to arrival. If the test result is positive, the traveller will be required to self-isolate until they have recovered and have tested negative on a PCR test. If travellers do not provide the above documentation, they will be required to take a PCR test for COVID-19 at their own expense within three days of arriving in Russia. You should check the specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines have in place in advance of your flight. Different airlines have different requirements and may refuse boarding if they are not met. In Moscow, express PCR COVID-19 tests are available in Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo airports as well as in a number of state and private clinics.\nThe period of temporary stay or permanent residence in Russia for foreigners and stateless persons, earlier extended until September 15, will be in place until December 15.

The latest advice for Moscow is available on the Mayor’s <a href=\"https://www.sobyanin.ru/\">website</a>. From 1 June in Moscow it is mandatory to wear a face mask at all times when leaving your place of residence and gloves in stores or other institutions, at work and when travelling by any type of public transport or taxi.

The type of test required is a RT-PCR test. The certificate with the test result should be in English. You should confirm that the test you intend to take, and the certificate you will receive, meets the requirements set by the authorities in Taiwan. If you already hold a valid Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) or Alien Permanent Resident Certificate (APRC), you do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. The requirement to provide a negative COVID-19 test report does not apply to returning ARC and APRC holders. For more information, you should visit the website of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En\">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a>. If you are in Taiwan you can also contact the ‘Information For Foreigners In Taiwan’ helpline on 0800-024-111. \n All airline passengers entering Taiwan are required to fill in a health declaration which includes travel history for the preceding 14 days. On arrival in Taiwan you are legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Local authorities monitor those self-isolating, and there are financial penalties for anyone breaching the law. In addition to completing a health declaration on arrival, you may be asked to install a local SIM card if you do not already have one. Mobile phone location monitoring will be used as part of the quarantine management process by local authorities. You will be required to provide temperature and health status updates to local authorities during self-isolation. Travellers from countries and territories that are designated as low risk by the local authorities may be permitted to self-isolate for a period less than 14 days. You should check the current regulations before you travel with the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in the country you plan to travel from. Travellers from the United Kingdom are required to complete the 14-day quarantine period.\n New rules allowing transits are in place. Foreign passengers, including people from Hong Kong and Macau, are allowed to transit through Taoyuan International Airport. Holders of People’s Republic of China (PRC) passports are not be permitted to transit in Taiwan. Those transiting will need to board connecting flights of the same airline company they fly in on. Transits must last less than 8 hours. Transit passengers, who need to wait for more than one hour, will remain separate from other passengers and stay in a separate area. Rules and procedures may change at short notice. Not all airlines are permitted to transit through Taiwan.\n <br>\n <br>\n Internal Restrictions: \n There are no domestic travel restrictions in Taiwan. On arrival in Taiwan, you will be required to take an allocated taxi to your self-isolation destination. Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport. If you use public transport and are not wearing a face mask, you may be fined up to NT$15,000. Be aware that some taxi drivers may refuse to take a passenger who is not wearing a face mask. Only a limited number of designated quarantine hotels may host self-isolating travellers. If you are planning to stay in a hotel to complete the self-isolation period, you should confirm that a room is available and that it meets your requirements prior to travelling. Due to an increased number of travellers now entering Taiwan, demand for the limited number of hotels permitted to host self-isolating travellers has increased, and you may find it difficult to find accommodation at short notice. For a list of designated quarantine hotels in Taipei, please visit Taipei City Government’s FAQ page <a href=\"https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A0EDC3930FBE7EFC&sms=5B794C46F3CDE718&s=6CBBBD4737D9391D\">here</a>.

Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has not outlined any changes to the quarantine requirements in addition to the closure of the border to most categories of foreigner. Therefore, if you are among the groups permitted to enter Ukraine, the country from which you are travelling will dictate whether or not you are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival in Ukraine. Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “green zone”, are not required to undergo self-isolation or observation on arrival. Travellers arriving from countries in what the Ukrainian authorities call the “red zone”, are required to undergo 14 days’ self-isolation proven by the <a href=\"https://visitukraine.today/#diya\">Dii Vdoma” tracking app</a>/. or quarantine in a Government-approved facility for 14 days upon arrival. Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is not necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine. Further information about taking the tests in Ukraine and terminating self-isolation in case of a negative result can be found via the ‘more detailed’ link of the ‘for citizens of “red zone” countries’ box on the Ukrainian authorities <a href=\"https://visitukraine.today/\">Visit Ukraine</a>/. Citizens of “red” countries who can prove that they have spent the last 14 days in “green” countries are treated as arriving from the “green zone”, and will not be required to isolate. Individuals whose travel originated in a “green” country but who have visited a “red” country prior to arriving to Ukraine (for example, those travelling by car transiting “red” countries) may be required to self-isolate or quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. Mandatory self-isolation or quarantine is no longer necessary if a traveller undergoes a PCR test and receives a negative result no more than 48 hours in advance of his/her arrival in Ukraine, or once in Ukraine. Currently, the UK falls into the “green zone”. Check the list of red and green zone countries by clicking the “more detailed” links in the “for citizens of green/red zones” information boxes. The red and green zone lists are updated frequently and can change quickly in response to the epidemic – you should check the lists regularly. Children under the age of 12, drivers and crew members of cargo vehicles, buses, train, locomotive, aircraft, sea and river vessels are also not required to undergo self-isolation or quarantine, provided they have not been in contact with a person with COVID-19. Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the “Dii Vdoma” mobile app. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian). More information about the app is available on the Cabinet of Ministers website or the Visit Ukraine webpage. Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the Dii Vdoma app, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre. Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ Visit Ukraine webpage. \n <br>\n <br>\n Internal restrictions:\nDomestic flights have now resumed, although some carriers are operating a reduced schedule. Public transport in cities and bus and train travel between regions have also resumed on a reduced scale. Coronavirus measures have been extended until 31 December. When in public places, including when travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m, wear protective masks and gloves. The number of passengers per vehicle is limited to the number of seats, with the exception of metro carriages. \nFailure to comply with restrictions may result in a fine or, in more serious cases, a prison sentence. Before taking public transport, you should consider whether you will be able to maintain social distancing. Restrictions are enacted locally, with Ukraine divided into four “colour zones” – green, yellow, orange and red - depending on the number and growth rate of new COVID-19 cases, hospital capacity and testing rates. In “green zones” social distancing and mask-wearing regulations remain in place, and mass events are legally limited to a maximum of 50 people. \nIn red zones, mass events are banned, public transport should be suspended, inter-city trains should not stop, and most non-essential facilities should close. This <a href=\"http://reachinitiative.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b8ea3d22c51246528abb47ef94f20edb&fbclid=IwAR0KHFOuRvgAOZjfkCyQpA1EzFUm8HmKH1UbcEezLzTTsQZr74YzZA6chAc\">interactive map</a>/ sets out the current status of the different regions of Ukraine. The zones can be updated on a daily basis – the government and local authorities have indicated that they may enact local lockdowns at short notice – and enforcement or relaxation of new rules may not happen immediately. You should check the status of regions regularly.\n In the “green” and “yellow” zones, most accommodation, including hotels and private rentals, is open to the public. In “orange” and “red” zones, accommodation services except for hotels should be closed. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the same rules as for being in public place. This includes: wearing a protective mask in all public areas, maintaining a minimum distance of 1.5m, if possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel.\n In “green” and “yellow” zones, shops, restaurants, cafes, religious establishments, beauty salons and hairdressers, museums, libraries, gyms, fitness centres, swimming pools, hardware stores, cobblers, dentists, auditors, lawyers and notaries may operate (providing appropriate hygiene and distancing measures are in place). The number of visitors to shopping centres, restaurants and sport facilities is limited to one person per 5 sq. m. Parks and recreation areas are open.\n When in public places, including when travelling on public transport and in taxis, you must maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 m and wear protective masks and gloves. \nIn “orange” zones, entertainment facilities and restaurants will have their hours restricted.

Check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut issued a travel advisory Wednesday 24 June that requires people arriving from US states with significant community spread of COVID-19 to quarantine for 14 days. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthga\">website</a>.

Hotels, barbers and outdoor cafes will reopen and air, rail traffic resume (Reuters, 12.08.2020)\n  <br>\n <br>\n International Restrictions:\n *Entry to Uzbekistan from 1 October 2020: The Uzbekistan Special Republican Commission has made changes to entry requirements for visitors arriving by air, rail and road which will come into force on 1 October 2020. The Commission is monitoring the epidemiological situation in foreign countries, and has categorised them as Red, Yellow and Green. The UK is currently categorised as Red. This categorisation is subject to constant review and could change at short notice. Anyone arriving in Uzbekistan on a direct flight from countries categorised as green, and who have been in these countries for 14 days prior to travel, will not be required to quarantine or self-isolate. Passengers arriving from ‘Yellow’ and ‘Red’ categories of countries – including those transiting a Yellow or Red country en route from a Green country - must present a negative Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for coronavirus issued within 72 hours of arrival. Passengers who fail to provide a valid PCR test certificate for any reason or who show any coronavirus symptoms on arrival must undergo a PCR test at their own expense at the border crossing point. Passengers who take a PCR test on arrival and who test positive will be quarantined for 14 days at a state facility or a dedicated hotel at their own expense. Passengers arriving from “Yellow” or “Red” category of countries with negative coronavirus PCR tests will have to undergo a mandatory 14 days self-isolation at the hotel or home. <br>\n*Entry to Uzbekistan until 1 October 2020: Until 1 October, only certain categories of persons – regardless of the category of the country they are coming from – are permitted to enter and leave Uzbekistan (i.e. accredited diplomats, permanently registered foreigners and some employees of international organisations).Entry for tourism is prohibited. Business visits are only permitted for representatives of foreign companies and other organisations currently operating in Uzbekistan as part of an investment project. The above restrictions on categories of visitors will be lifted from 1 October 2020. The Uzbek authorities have extended the validity of extant visas until 1 November. <br>\n*Transiting Uzbekistan: If you wish to transit Uzbekistan en route to another country, you will need to seek permission in advance through the British Embassy in Tashkent who will then need to submit a formal request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <br>\n*Testing/Screening on arrival: All arrivals into Uzbekistan will be subject to a medical evaluation for symptoms of coronavirus, including temperature checks. Any person showing symptoms including high fever, coughing or respiratory difficulties will be will be required to undergo a test for COVID-19 at a government facility and may be isolated at government facility (or approved hotel with medical and security controls in place) at their own cost. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: Eligible visitors arriving in Uzbekistan from a country categorised as Green (Japan, South Korea, China and Israel) or who have been in one of these countries 14 days prior to arrival will not be subject to any mandatory quarantine or self-isolation period unless they display symptoms on arrival. Those arriving in Uzbekistan from a country categorised as Yellow or who have been in one of these countries 14 days prior to arrival are subject to a mandatory period of 14-days self-isolation on arrival. Travel from a country categorised as Red (UAE, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Russia and other CIS countries and the USA) is only permitted for Uzbek Nationals repatriating from these countries. All arrivals from countries categorised as Red or who have been in one of these countries in the 14 days prior to arrival are subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a government facility. <br>\n*Data collection: No track and trace app is currently available. However, all visitors arriving into the country are registered by Uzbek Authorities. If arriving from a country categorised as Yellow it is mandatory to provide the address where they will self-isolate for the 14-day period. <br>\n*Testing on departure: All persons departing Uzbekistan by air are required to undergo temperature checks. Anyone showing high temperature and/or other COVID-19 symptoms will be denied boarding. Depending on the destination country of the flight, the authorities of that country may also require other pre-boarding checks in addition to those conducted by the Uzbek authorities.\n <br>\n <br>\n Internal Restrictions: \n Domestic flights have resumed. Taxis operate to Tashkent International Airport. Domestic rail services resumed on 15 August. Public transportation resumed on 17 August in Tashkent, the capital. Citizens are required to wear a medical mask when entering the bus, otherwise passengers will not be allowed on the bus. Restrictive measures had previously been eased, with the country being divided into red, yellow and green zones with differing restrictions in each. However, following a second spike in infections, the entire country has been re-categorised as a ‘Red Zone’. Use of private vehicles is permitted only between from 07:00 – 10:00 and from 17:00 – 20:00, and only for essential purposes such as going to/from work or buying food or medication. Permission is required for use of private vehicles outside of these hours, though private travel will be permitted in the case of medical emergencies. Care should be taken if using taxis as some operators might not be fully complying with COVID-19 hygiene measures. Inter-regional travel is prohibited other than for vehicles transporting agricultural produce and specifically authorised private vehicles. Exception made to travel from Tashkent to Tashkent region and vice versa for private vehicles only from 07:00-10:00 and from 17:00-20:00. Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS or up to 10 years imprisonment.\n Hotels (other than those designated for use as quarantine locations), motels and guest houses are closed.\n Persons aged over 65 are banned from public spaces. Gatherings of more than three people in any public place are prohibited. Between 23:00 – 07:00 citizens are prohibited from any movement in public unless for medical reasons (this includes visits to pharmacies). Security force checkpoints are in place across the country.
